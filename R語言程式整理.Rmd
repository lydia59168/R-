## 1.Set Up

### How to set up R?

First, we need to install R.  If we didn't install R, we won't be able to use anything.  We can install the software R from their official website <https://www.r-project.org/>.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
